    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade beef stock, crafted from the rich, meaty bones such as shanks, knuckles, and marrow bones, brings unparalleled flavor to any dish it touches. Simmered slowly with a blend of aromatic vegetables and herbs, these bones release deep, complex flavors along with gelatin and essential nutrients, creating a robust and hearty base that enhances soups, stews, and sauces. Unlike store-bought options that often fall flat with artificial flavorings and preservatives, homemade beef stock offers a pure, authentic taste with a velvety texture that transforms your cooking. The deep, umami-rich character of a homemade stock lends unmatched depth, proving that the best dishes always start with a homemade foundation.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 lb (2 kg) beef bones with some meat attached</li>
        <li>4 fresh flat-leaf (Italian) parsley sprigs</li>
        <li>1 fresh thyme sprig</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>2 large carrots, cut into 2-inch (5-cm) slices</li>
        <li>1 large onion, cut into 2-inch (5-cm) slices</li>
        <li>2 leeks, light green and dark green parts only, sliced into 2-inch (5-cm) chunks and rinsed carefully</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Place the beef bones in a large roasting pan. Place in the oven and roast until browned, about 11/2 hours, stirring a few times to give the bones an even color.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, wrap the parsley, thyme, and bay leaf in a piece of cheesecloth (muslin) and secure the bundle with kitchen string to make a bouquet garni.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from the oven. Remove the bones and place them in a large stock- pot. Add about 3 cups (24 fl oz/750 ml) water to the roasting pan and place it over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil and deglaze the pan, stirring to scrape the browned bits from the pan’s bottom. The water will become a rich brown color.</li>
        <li>Transfer the deglazed juices from the roasting pan to the stockpot and add enough cold water (about 14 cups/3.5 l) to just cover the bones. Add the carrots, onion, and leeks and the bouquet garni.</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, then reduce the heat to as low as possible. Let simmer, uncovered, for 4 hours, using a spoon or skimmer to regularly skim off the foam that rises to the surface. Taste and adjust the seasoning.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and let the stock cool for 1/2 hour. Remove the bones and pour the stock into a large bowl through a fine- meshed strainer lined with cheesecloth. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>With a large spoon, remove the hardened fat from the surface and discard it. Line the strainer with cheesecloth, then pour the stock through again to make sure the stock is fat free. The stock should be clear.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If not using immediately, pour into containers and refrigerate. The stock will keep for up to 3 days in the refrigerator or 3 months in the freezer. Makes 3 qt (3 l).</p>
