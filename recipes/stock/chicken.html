    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade chicken stock made from leftover parts such as the necks and backs of a whole chicken is a culinary secret that infuses dishes with unmatched depth and warmth. After cutting a chicken into parts, these often-overlooked sections can be simmered with aromatic vegetables and herbs to create a rich, golden broth. Unlike store-bought chicken stock, which often contains additives and lacks true flavor complexity, this homemade version captures the essence of real chicken, imparting a savory, comforting taste that elevates soups, stews, and gravies. The slow cooking of necks and backs extracts collagen and nutrients, producing a luscious, full-bodied stock that adds both flavor and nourishment to your meals.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 fresh flat-leaf (Italian) parsley sprigs</li>
        <li>1 fresh thyme sprig</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>6lb (3kg) chicken necks and backs</li>
        <li>3 celery stalks</li>
        <li>3 carrots, peeled</li>
        <li>2 onions, root ends cut off, cut into halves</li>
        <li>2 leeks, white and light green parts only, cleaned and sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wrap the parsley, thyme, and bay leaf in a piece of cheesecloth (muslin) and secure the bundle with kitchen string to make a bouquet garni.</li>
        <li>Combine the bouquet garni, chicken parts, celery, carrots, onions, and leeks in a large stockpot. Add enough cold water to just cover the ingredients (about 14 cups/3.5 l). Slowly bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to as low as possible and let simmer, uncovered, for 3 hours, using a spoon or skimmer to regularly skim off the foam that rises to the surface. Taste and adjust the seasoning.</li>
        <li>Strain the stock into a bowl through a colander or strainer lined with cheesecloth. Let cool at room temperature for about 1 hour, then cover and refrigerate for at least 1/2 hour or up to overnight. With a large spoon, remove the hardened fat from the surface and discard it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Cover and refrigerate the stock for up to 3 days, or pour into airtight containers or zippered plastic freezer bags and freeze for up to 3 months. Makes about 3 qt (3 l).</p>
