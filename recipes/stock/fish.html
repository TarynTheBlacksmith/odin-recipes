    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade fish stock, made from the often-discarded bones, heads, and trimmings of white fish, is a secret ingredient that transforms ordinary seafood dishes into masterpieces. This fragrant stock, simmered gently with hints of lemon, herbs, and vegetables, infuses dishes with the delicate, oceanic notes of the sea itself. Unlike store-bought fish stock, which can be bland and overly salty, a homemade version sings with bright, clean flavors and carries a silky depth that highlights the natural sweetness of seafood. Perfect for bouillabaisse, risottos, or velvety seafood bisques, this stock provides a subtle, nuanced base that transports your culinary creations to the level of fine coastal dining. With just a pot, patience, and the parts of the fish you once overlooked, you unlock the secret to truly exceptional cooking.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 lb (1 kg) heads, skin, bones, and flesh of fresh white-fleshed fish, such as halibut or sea bass</li>
        <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 carrots, unpeeled and cut into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces</li>
        <li>6 fresh flat-leaf (Italian) parsley stems</li>
        <li>2 celery stalks with leaves, cut into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>10 white peppercorns</li>
        <li>5 fresh dill sprigs</li>
        <li>1 lemon, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large stockpot over low heat, warm the oil and sauté the fish parts for 2–3 minutes. Do not let them brown. Add all the remain- ing ingredients to the pot with enough cold water to just cover the ingredients (about 14 cups/3.5 l). Bring to a boil over medium- high heat. Reduce the heat to low and let simmer, uncovered, for 45 minutes, using a spoon or skimmer to regularly skim off the foam that rises to the surface. Taste and adjust the seasoning</li>
        <li>Strain the stock into a bowl through a colander or strainer lined with cheesecloth (muslin). Let cool for about 1 hour, then cover and refrigerate for at least 1/2 hour or overnight. With a large spoon, remove the hardened fat from the surface and discard it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If the stock is not to be used at once, cover and refrigerate it for up to 3 days, or pour into airtight containers or zippered plastic freezer bags and freeze for up to 3 months.  If frozen, it should be reboiled before using.  Makes about 3 qt (3 l).</p>
    <p><em>Variation Tip:  This stock may also be made with shrimp, crab, or lobster shells, in place of or in addition to the fish parts.</em></p>
