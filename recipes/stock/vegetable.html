    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade vegetable stock made from leftover vegetable parts—such as carrot tops, onion skins, celery leaves, and potato peels—elevates any dish with rich, natural flavors that simply can’t be matched by store-bought options. Utilizing these scraps not only minimizes food waste but also allows for a customizable taste profile, highlighting the deep, earthy, and sweet notes of fresh produce. Unlike store-bought stocks, which often contain preservatives and added sodium, a homemade version bursts with pure, layered complexity that enhances soups, sauces, and grains, making every recipe more vibrant and wholesome.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 whole leeks, white and green parts, sliced and rinsed carefully</li>
        <li>4 celery stalks with leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>1 fennel bulb, chopped</li>
        <li>4 carrots, peeled and sliced lengthwise</li>
        <li>1 red potato, diced</li>
        <li>1/4 lb (125 g) mushrooms, quartered</li>
        <li>6 whole cloves garlic</li>
        <li>8 fresh flat-leaf (italian) parsley stems</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>8 whole peppercorns</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all the ingredients in a large stockpot. Add enough cold water to just cover the ingredients (about 10 cups/2.5 l). Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and let simmer, uncovered, for 11/2 hours, using a spoon or skimmer to regularly skim off the foam that rises to the surface. Taste and adjust the seasoning.</li>
        <li>Let the stock cool slightly. Strain through a fine meshed strainer lined with cheesecloth (muslin) into a large bowl. Press on the vegetables with the back of a spoon to extract as much of the flavor as possible. Cool to room temperature and refrigerate.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The stock will keep for up to 3 days in the refrigerator or 3 months in the freezer.  Makes about 2 qt (2 l).</p>
    <p><em>Variation Tip: This stock may be prepared using additional vegetables as desired, such as tomatoes, rutabagas, parsnips, turnips, or celery root (celeriac).</em></p>
